    "When an agent interacts with the environment, the states, actions, and rewards the agent experiences are sequential by nature. If the agent tries to learn from these consecutive experiences it can run into problems due to the strong correlations between them. To avoid this, we employ a technique known as **Experience Replay** to generate uncorrelated experiences for training our agent. Experience replay consists of storing the agent's experiences (i.e the states, actions, and rewards the agent receives) in a memory buffer and then sampling a random mini-batch of experiences from the buffer to do the learning. The experience tuples $(S_t, A_t, R_t, S_{t+1})$ will be added to the memory buffer at each time step as the agent interacts with the environment.\n",

    "* The `compute_loss` function takes in a mini-batch of experience tuples. This mini-batch of experience tuples is unpacked to extract the `states`, `actions`, `rewards`, `next_states`, and `done_vals`. You should keep in mind that these variables are *TensorFlow Tensors* whose size will depend on the mini-batch size. For example, if the mini-batch size is `64` then both `rewards` and `done_vals` will be TensorFlow Tensors with `64` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using `if/else` statements to set the $y$ targets will not work when the variables are tensors with many elements. However, notice that you can use the `done_vals` to implement the above in a single line of code. To do this, recall that the `done` variable is a Boolean variable that takes the value `True` when an episode terminates at step $j+1$ and it is `False` otherwise. Taking into account that a Boolean value of `True` has the numerical value of `1` and a Boolean value of `False` has the numerical value of `0`, you can use the factor `(1 - done_vals)` to implement the above in a single line of code. Here's a hint: notice that `(1 - done_vals)` has a value of `0` when `done_vals` is `True` and a value of `1` when `done_vals` is `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, compute the loss by calculating the Mean-Squared Error (`MSE`) between the `y_targets` and the `q_values`. To calculate the mean-squared error you should use the already imported package `MSE`:\n",

Note that we are also using the `@tf.function` decorator to increase performance. Without this decorator our training will take twice as long.
